# deltaVFS is an indev user-mode immutable virtual filesystem.

### Building
To build deltaVFS, first ensure that Nim is installed on your system. My recommended method is with https://github.com/dom96/choosenim.

Then, navigate to the top-level directory of the project and execute `nimble build` in your terminal. `deltavfs.exe` and `payload.dll' can be found in the `bin/` directory once complete.
